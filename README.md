# Audio-Based-Stress-Detection-Through-Vocal-Pattern-Analysis
Design and implement robust audio feature extraction pipeline (process of analyzing an audio signal and extracting key characteristics) - Develop efficient machine learning models for stress detection - Create real-time processing framework for immediate feedback - Performance Targets:   - Achieve >85% accuracy detection

Methodology

System Architecture:
- Audio Processing Module (Converts raw audio signals into a form suitable for analysis)
- Feature Engineering Layer (a critical stage in machine learning workflows where raw data is transformed into meaningful and informative features that improve the performance of predictive models)
- Model Training (process of teaching a machine learning algorithm to learn patterns)
- Evaluation (Outcome)
Dataset:
- 5 emotional categories â€“Anger,Sadness,Happiness,Disgust,Fear
- 22050 Hz sampling rate
- 16-bit WAV format
